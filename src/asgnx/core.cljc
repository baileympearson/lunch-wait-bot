;; to ask the question (e.g., sending messages to the experts). The string
;; is the response that is going to be sent back to the person that asked
;; the question (e.g. "Asking 2 expert(s) for an answer to ....").
;;
;; The correct string response to a valid question should be produced with
;; the `experts-question-msg` function above.

;; Think about how you are going to figure out where to route messages
;; when an expert answers (see the conversations query) and make sure you

;; If there isn't a question, you should return "You must ask a valid question."

;; Why this strange architecture? By returning a list of the actions to take,

(defn handle-message
  "
    This function orchestrates the processing of incoming messages
    and glues all of the pieces of the processing pipeline together.

    The basic flow to handle a message is as follows:

    1. Create the router that will be used later to find the
       function to handle the message
    2. Parse the message
    3. Load any saved state that is going to be needed to process
       the message (e.g., querying the list of experts, etc.)
    4. Find the function that can handle the message
    5. Call the handler function with the state from #3 and
       the message
    6. Run the different actions that the handler returned...these actions
       will be bound to different implementations depending on the environemnt
       (e.g., in test, the actions aren't going to send real text messages)
    7. Return the string response to the message
